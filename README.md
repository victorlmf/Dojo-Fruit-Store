# Great Number Game

Created a site that allows a user to play this guessing game. 

Upon loading, the server would "pick" a random number between 1-100 and store this random number in session. Allow the user to guess the number--tell them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number, notify them and offer to play again.

Added a leaderboard page to show the winner's name and attemtps that were took to guess correctly.
